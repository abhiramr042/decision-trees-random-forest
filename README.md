# ðŸŒ³ Decision Trees & Random Forest - Heart Disease Prediction (Task 5)

This repository contains my submission for **Task 5** of the **AI & ML Internship**, where I implemented **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** classifiers using the Heart Disease dataset.

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

To train, evaluate, and compare the performance of **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** classifiers for binary classification.

---

## âœ… Steps Covered

1. Imported and explored the Heart Disease dataset
2. Split data into **train** and **test** sets
3. Trained a **Decision Tree Classifier**
4. Visualized the decision tree
5. Controlled overfitting using `max_depth`
6. Trained a **Random Forest Classifier**
7. Compared model performance
8. Plotted feature importances
9. Performed **cross-validation** for model robustness
